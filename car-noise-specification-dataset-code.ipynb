    "The noise level of cars could be an indicator of both car’s condition and manufacturing quality. Drivers could use noise level to determine if an car suits their needs or if their current car is in a healthy state. On the other hand, manufactures could use noise level to assets their cars quality compared to the market. Luxury cars compete to have low noise level, while sports car usually neglect this factor. In this project we compile data from different sources to arrive to a dataset having many cars’ manufacturing specification mapped to its noise level at different speed. The compiled dataset could be utilized in evaluating cars noise level or in analyzing which technical specification has the major effect on cars’ noise level.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially we scrape data from https://www.auto-decibel-db.com (hereafter referred AD). This website has nearly 2000 data entries about cars' cabin noise level. Each car in the website has its cabin noise (measured in decibel) at different speed. The website doesn't provide further information about the source or the methodology of its collected data, yet it's the most comprehensive data about the subject I could found. Another source which might be used for verification can be found at https://www.edmunds.com. While edmunds.com states its methodology of collecting noise level, its dataset is embedded in PDF files and is not comprehensive compared to the former.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After scrapping the noise level of cars, we use the available information we have about each car to find its specification. In the scrapped dataset from AD there's 4 features which can be used to identify same car's specification in other datasets: brand, model, year, and spec. After looking up the Web for websites and APIs having detailed and comprehensive data about cars, we decided on http://www.carqueryapi.com API (hereafter referred CQA). Though it's not accurate for some cars, and it has different spelling from our AD, it's the most accessible data we could find. In this section we map each car in AD to its equivalence in cqa using the 3 features: brand, model, and year. We first specify the model_id in CQA and then we will use model_id to retrieve the full specification of the car. Due to the limitation imposed by caranddriver.com on the number of requests (60 requests), we used Tor bridge to alternate IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we look up for the full specification of each car in CQA using its model_id. In this section we added 60 features of specification of nearly a 1000 car in AD. We refer to each feature pulled from CQA by a postfix added to its column name: '_cqa'. At the end we succeeded in getting specification of 1067 car out of 1895 in  AD. We couldn’t find specification for all cars in AD due to either different naming of cars between AD and QC, or the car doesn’t exist in QC."

    "After scrapping the noise level of cars, we use the available information we have about each car to find its specification. In the scrapped dataset from auto-decibel-db.com (hereafter referred AD) there's 4 features which can be used to identify same car's specification in other datasets: brand, model, year, and spec. After looking up the Web for websites and APIs having detailed and comprehensive data about cars, we decided on http://caranddriver.com/ API (hereafter referred CQA). Though it's not accurate for some cars, and it has different spelling from our AD, it's the most accessable data we could find. In this section we map each car in AD to its equivalence in cqa using the 3 features: brand, model, and year. We first specify the model_id in CQA and then we will use model_id to retrieve the full specification of the car. Due to the limitation imposed by caranddriver.com on the number of requests (60 requests), we used Tor bridge to alternate IP address."
